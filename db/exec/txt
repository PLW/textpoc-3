For those interested in a serious description of Kepler's work, I recommend "How Kepler Discovered the Elliptical Orbit", Eric J. Aiton, The Mathematical Gazette, Vol. 59, No. 410 (Dec., 1975), pp. 250-260.  There you will read about the sequence of steps that lead from Ptolemaic eccentric circles and epicycles, to ovals (which were approximated by ellipses, but without putting the sun at the focus), to the correct theory we now have.  A good description of Kepler's method might be puzzle solving, where the clues combined physical observation with the a requirement of minimal and unifying physical hypotheses.  Kepler's task was to find some underlying force relations and then deduce the corresponding orbits and match the given observations.   Key to the process were the historically more accurate observations provided by Tycho Brahe.  Brahe's observations made it clear (for the first time!) that the Ptolemaic model was no longer accurate to within observational error.  A circular orbit is simpler than an eliptical orbit, but a single ellipse is simpler that an eccentric circle with an epicycle.   Furthermore, there seems to be no simple physical process that would account to the constraints required to keep a planet moving on an epicycle.  I have actually no idea what Kepler's work has to do with defining the word 'courage' - which seems like the domain of linguists.
