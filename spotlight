Disabling Spotlight
Launch Terminal and type the following:

sudo nano /etc/hostconfig

Navigate using the arrow keys down the following entry:
SPOTLIGHT=-YES-
Change
  SPOTLIGHT=-YES-
to
  SPOTLIGHT=-NO-

Save /etc/hostconfig by hitting Control-O and the return key,
next hit Control-X to exit the nano editor

Next, you’ll want to disable the index by typing the following in the Terminal:
  mdutil -i off /
And to erase the current Spotlight index, type:
  mdutil -E /
That’s pretty much it, on your next reboot, Spotlight will be completely disabled.

Re-Enable Spotlight
If you want to enable Spotlight again, follow the same steps as above, but change
  SPOTLIGHT=-NO-
to
  SPOTLIGHT=-YES-
and then type
  mdutil -i on /
in the Terminal

Reboot, and Spotlight is back as usual
